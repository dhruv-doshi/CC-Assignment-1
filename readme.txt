This assignment majorly requires the use of HTML & CSS.

All the layout designs are given in the 'design' folder.

SVGs and required icons can be found in 'images' folder.

The required fonts and color codes are mentioned inn the style-guide.

You are expected to implement the mobile and desktop view in a single HTML file (refer 'media queries' if you don't know about this)
